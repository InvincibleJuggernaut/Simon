<h2>Introduction</h2>

Simon is a memory based game that used to be very popular during the 70s. The player needs to remember the sequence of colours. Each colour is accompanied with its respective tone. The player needs to remember the sequence and press the corresponding buttons accordingly. The game starts with one colour. As the player progresses through the levels, a random colour is added towards the end of the already accumulated sequence.</p>
